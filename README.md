🧪 Hypotheses  This study analyzes COVID-19 trends in the City of Chicago from January 2020 to December 2022, focusing on hospitalization, testing, age distribution, vaccination, and outcomes.

**Hypothesis 1**: Hospitalization and Mortality Trends

From January 2020 to December 2022, the City of Chicago experienced a relatively low hospitalization rate (54.38%) and death rate (6.95%) among approximately 4.26 million COVID-19 cases.
This is hypothesized to be driven by a significant decline in case severity by December 2022, resulting in fewer hospitalizations and lower mortality.

**Hypothesis 2**: Age Group 18–29 Had the Highest Testing Rates

Between January 2020 and December 2021, individuals aged 18–29 in Chicago recorded the highest COVID-19 testing rates (approximately 88.14%), with a statistically significant peak observed on Mondays.
This age group also represented the largest population segment tested (922,516 out of 3,720,049 total tests), indicating higher testing engagement compared to other age groups.

**Hypothesis 3**: Vaccination Uptake Peaked in December 2022

COVID-19 vaccination data from January 2021 to December 2022 shows that December 2022 recorded the highest number of doses administered in Chicago.
A total of 3.91 million doses were administered, including 2.06 million first doses and 1.86 million second doses, leading to the highest cumulative vaccination count (171 million records) and indicating peak vaccination coverage by the end of 2022.

**Hypothesis 4**: Vaccination Reduced Severe Outcomes Over Time

As vaccination coverage increased across Chicago, COVID-19 severity indicators—hospitalizations and deaths—declined over time.
This hypothesis suggests a negative correlation between vaccination uptake and severe health outcomes, especially evident in the later stages of the pandemic.

**Hypothesis 5**: Temporal and Behavioral Patterns Influenced Case Detection

COVID-19 testing and case detection exhibited strong temporal patterns, including weekday-based spikes (notably Mondays) and variation across age groups.
This suggests that behavioral factors, testing accessibility, and reporting cycles significantly influenced observed case trends rather than disease transmission alone.
