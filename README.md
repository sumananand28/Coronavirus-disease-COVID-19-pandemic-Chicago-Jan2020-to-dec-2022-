🦠 COVID-19 Pandemic Analysis & Data Visualization(TABLEAU,SQL,Advanced Excel)

Chicago | January 2020 – December 2022

This project analyzes the COVID-19 pandemic trends in the City of Chicago from January 2020 through December 2022, using publicly available datasets from the U.S. Government.
The analysis focuses on cases, hospitalizations, deaths, testing behavior, and vaccination patterns, presented through data visualization and analytical insights.


🔍 Project Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented public health challenges.
This project aims to explore how testing behavior, age demographics, vaccination uptake, and geographic equity influenced COVID-19 outcomes in Chicago.

Using multiple COVID-19 datasets, we identify patterns, correlations, and disparities through visual analytics.

**🎯 Objective**

The primary objectives of this project are to:

Identify trends in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths

Analyze testing behavior across age groups and weekdays

Examine vaccination and booster uptake trends

Understand racial, ethnic, and geographic disparities

Communicate insights using clear, interactive visualizations

**📊 Datasets Used**

All datasets were sourced from data.gov and cover the City of Chicago.

Key Datasets:

COVID-19 Daily Testing (By Person)

COVID-19 Vaccinations by Age & Race/Ethnicity

COVID-19 Vaccinations by ZIP Code

COVID-19 Daily Rolling Average (Cases, Deaths, Hospitalizations)

COVID-19 Vaccinations by Region, Age & Race/Ethnicity

Time Period: January 2020 – December 2022
Format: CSV files

**🧹 Data Preparation & Cleaning**

The data preparation process included:

Removing duplicate records

Handling missing values (less than 2% using standard data quality rules)

Error correction and validation

Removing empty rows

Data normalization and exploration

The cleaned datasets were then used for trend analysis and visualization.

**🧪 Hypotheses**

Hypothesis 1: Decline in Severe Outcomes

Lower COVID-19 positive cases resulted in a decline in hospitalization (54.38%) and death rates (6.95%) over time.

Hypothesis 2: Highest Testing Among Ages 18–29

Individuals aged 18–29 exhibited the highest testing rates (88.14%), with a statistically significant peak on Mondays (17.71%).

Hypothesis 3: Vaccination Uptake Peaked in December 2022

The highest number of vaccine doses were administered in December 2022, driven by increased testing and cumulative vaccination efforts.

Hypothesis 4: Booster Disparities Across Racial Groups

Significant disparities exist in booster dose uptake, with White non-Latinx populations showing higher booster rates compared to other racial and ethnic groups.

Hypothesis 5: Geographic Inequities in First-Dose Vaccination

Vaccination coverage varied by region, with North and Near South zones showing higher first-dose uptake than Far South and Southwest regions.

**📈 Key Insights**

COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths show a lagged but strongly correlated pattern

Testing behavior varies significantly by weekday, age, and race

Vaccination efforts faced challenges in booster retention

Racial and geographic disparities highlight inequities in healthcare access

Visual analytics effectively reveal temporal and spatial patterns

**🛠 Tools & Technologies**

Tableau – Data visualization & dashboards

CSV / Excel – Data preparation

Public Health Datasets – data.gov

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**🚀 Why This Project Matters**

This project demonstrates how data visualization and analytics can be used to:

Support public health decision-making

Identify inequities in healthcare access

Communicate complex trends clearly to stakeholders

🧪 Hypotheses  This study analyzes COVID-19 trends in the City of Chicago from January 2020 to December 2022, focusing on hospitalization, testing, age distribution, vaccination, and outcomes.

**Hypothesis 1**: Hospitalization and Mortality Trends

From January 2020 to December 2022, the City of Chicago experienced a relatively low hospitalization rate (54.38%) and death rate (6.95%) among approximately 4.26 million COVID-19 cases.
This is hypothesized to be driven by a significant decline in case severity by December 2022, resulting in fewer hospitalizations and lower mortality.

**Hypothesis 2**: Age Group 18–29 Had the Highest Testing Rates

Between January 2020 and December 2021, individuals aged 18–29 in Chicago recorded the highest COVID-19 testing rates (approximately 88.14%), with a statistically significant peak observed on Mondays.
This age group also represented the largest population segment tested (922,516 out of 3,720,049 total tests), indicating higher testing engagement compared to other age groups.

**Hypothesis 3**: Vaccination Uptake Peaked in December 2022

COVID-19 vaccination data from January 2021 to December 2022 shows that December 2022 recorded the highest number of doses administered in Chicago.
A total of 3.91 million doses were administered, including 2.06 million first doses and 1.86 million second doses, leading to the highest cumulative vaccination count (171 million records) and indicating peak vaccination coverage by the end of 2022.

**Hypothesis 4**: Vaccination Reduced Severe Outcomes Over Time

As vaccination coverage increased across Chicago, COVID-19 severity indicators—hospitalizations and deaths—declined over time.
This hypothesis suggests a negative correlation between vaccination uptake and severe health outcomes, especially evident in the later stages of the pandemic.

**Hypothesis 5**: Temporal and Behavioral Patterns Influenced Case Detection

COVID-19 testing and case detection exhibited strong temporal patterns, including weekday-based spikes (notably Mondays) and variation across age groups.
This suggests that behavioral factors, testing accessibility, and reporting cycles significantly influenced observed case trends rather than disease transmission alone.
